            <p class="mb-4">This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Revenue Defender agrees to provide (i) certain hosted "software as a service" ("Subscription Services") for certain software applications (each such application together with any applicable documentation thereto, and programming and user interfaces therefor, a "Platform") to Authorized Users, as further set forth on each order form ("Order Form") and (ii) if applicable, all other implementation services, customization, integration, data import and export, monitoring, technical support, maintenance, training, backup and recovery, and change management ("Professional Services" together with Subscription Services, the "Services") related to Customer's access to, and use of, such Subscription Services and each Platform, as further set forth on each statement of services ("Statement of Work") issued hereunder (Order Forms and Statements of Professional Services are sometimes referred to jointly as a "Statement of Services").</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">1.2 The Services; Access and Use License.</h3>

Authorized User subscriptions are for designated Authorized Users and cannot be shared or used by more than one Authorized User, but may be reassigned to new Authorized Users replacing former Authorized Users who no longer require ongoing use of the applicable Platform.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.3 Authorized User Conditions to Use.</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">As a condition to access and use of a Platform, (i) each Authorized User shall agree to abide by the terms of Revenue Defender's end-user terms of use which it may adopt from time to time, (ii) Customer Users shall agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement, or a subset hereof, and (iii) Vendor Users shall agree to abide by the terms of the then-current Revenue Defender Vendor Terms of Service applicable to such Platform, and, in each case, Customer shall ensure such compliance.

            <p class="mb-4">Customer shall use, and will ensure that all Authorized Users use, each Platform, Software, and the Services in full compliance with this Agreement, Revenue Defender's end-user terms of use and all applicable laws and regulations. Customer represents and warrants that it (i) has accessed and reviewed any terms of use or other policies relating to a Platform provided by Revenue Defender, (ii) understands the requirements thereof, and (iii) agrees to comply therewith. Revenue Defender may suspend Customer's account and access to each Platform and performance of the Services at any time and without notice if Revenue Defender believes that Customer is in violation of this Agreement.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.3 Cooperation.</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Customer Users to be, at all times, educated and trained in the proper use and operation each Platform such Customer Users utilize, and to ensure that each Platform is used in accordance with applicable manuals, instructions, specifications and documentation provided by Revenue Defender from time to time.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.5 Customer Systems.</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Customer shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining—both the functionality and security of—any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use each Platform, including modems, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networking, web servers and the like.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.6 Restrictions on Export.</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Customer may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or reexport of the Software or anything related to a Platform, Software or Services, or any direct product thereof in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.7 DFARS.</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">Revenue Defender will defend Customer against any claim, suit, demand, or action made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that the Services, or Customer's use or access thereof in accordance with this Agreement, infringes any intellectual property rights of such third party, and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from any damages, losses, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorney's fees) finally awarded against Customer in connection with or in settlement of any such claim, suit, demand, or action. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of any Platform or Service (i) not supplied by Revenue Defender, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with Customer specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery, or granting of access, by Revenue Defender, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where Customer's use of the Services is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement. If, due to a claim of infringement, a Platform is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or is believed by Revenue Defender to be infringing, Revenue Defender may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify such Platform to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for Customer a license to continue using such Platform, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement and Customer's rights hereunder and provide Customer a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for such Platform.
